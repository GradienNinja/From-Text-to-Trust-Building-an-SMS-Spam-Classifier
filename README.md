# SMS Spam Classifier
In this project, I built a SMS spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. I started by loading the dataset, which initially caused a UnicodeDecodeError because it wasn’t UTF-8 encoded. Switching to latin1 solved the issue. The dataset also contained extra columns filled with NaNs, so I dropped those and renamed the remaining columns to label and message for clarity.
Next, I preprocessed the text data by converting the messages into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, since machine learning models cannot directly work with text. After that, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. I then trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training data. Initially, the model had lower recall for spam messages, but after tuning parameters like smoothing (alpha) and adjusting the vectorizer, the performance improved significantly.
Finally, I evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final results were around 97% accuracy, with spam precision at 98% and spam recall at 81%, showing that the model can effectively detect most spam messages while keeping false positives low. Overall, this notebook demonstrates the full pipeline of loading messy data, preprocessing text, training a model, and evaluating it properly.
